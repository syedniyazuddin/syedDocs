MutationObserver allows you to provide a function that is called asynchronously when certain parts of the DOM change, such as adding a child to a node, changing an attribute on a node, or changing the text on a node. As the changes happen, the MutationObserver records them as MutationRecords and then calls a user provided callback at a later time with all the MutationRecords that are pending.
==============================================================================================
 
 function callback(mutationList, observer) { // this piece of code is. if a user clicks the back button when he/she is at payment page and move forword then the loader should show
                mutationList.forEach(function(mutation) {
                    switch(mutation.type) {
                        case 'childList':
                            if(mutation.target.className==='paymentTypeContainer sopcc err cc_payment_type'){
 			    //your code here
			    }
                            break;
                    }
                });
                
            }
